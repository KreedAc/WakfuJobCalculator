It might mean that we don't have the right words to describe the thing in question, because it's completely unprecedented, because it's unlike anything we've ever known, or maybe also because we don't have the lexical knowledge necessary to choose the right words that will best express the indescribable nature of the thing. So we hide all this uncertainty behind phrases like: \"You see?! It's indescribable!\", said with deep conviction. But is that really the end of the story? If we search deep inside, maybe an exact and appropriate description will reveal itself. Something sufficiently clear, and at the time sufficiently abstract to facilitate understanding of the described thing. If the words aren't sufficient, maybe it's necessary to invent new ones? Words coming from the heart. Words which speak for themselves when the limits of language have been reached. The indescribable, ultimately, is above all an unknown, which requires only that we put forth the effort to understand it, to let your imagination, your reason, and your feelings play in order to better understand and therefore find the words that could describe it. But that would be too much work for a simple breastplate description.\t"},{"id":29277,"name":"Nonsensical Epaulettes","description":"The good news is, you'll never misunderstand their meaning, because they have none."},{"id":29278,"name":"Nonsensical Epaulettes","description":"The good news is, you'll never misunderstand their meaning, because they have none."},{"id":29279,"name":"Mysterious Boots\t","description":"This mysterious headgear seem to be inhabited by some evil presence.
